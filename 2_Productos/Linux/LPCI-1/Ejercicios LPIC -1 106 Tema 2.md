# Guided Exercises
##### 1. What type of application provides windowed shell sessions in the desktop environment?
- R: Any terminal emulator like Konsole, Gnome terminal, xterm, etc., will give access to a local interactive shell session.
##### 2. Due to the variety of Linux desktop environments, the same application may have more than one version, each of them best suited for a particular widget toolkit. For example, the bittorrent client Transmission has two versions: transmission-gtk and transmission-qt. Which of the two should be installed to ensure maximum integration with KDE?
- R: KDE is built on top of the Qt library, so the Qt version — transmission-qt — should be installed.
##### 3. What Linux desktop environments are recommended for low-cost single board computers with little processing power? 
- R:  Basic desktop environments that don’t use too much visual effects, such as Xfce and LXDE.

# Explorational Exercises
##### 1. There are two ways to copy and paste text in the X Window System: using the traditional Ctrl + c and Ctrl + v keystrokes (also available in the window menu) or to use the mouse middle-button click to paste the currently selected text. What’s the appropriate way to copy and paste text from a terminal emulator?
- R: Interactive shell sessions assign the Ctrl + c keystroke to stop program execution, so the middle-button method is recommended. 
##### 2. Most desktop environments assign the Alt + F2 keyboard shortcut to the Run program window, where programs can be executed in a command line fashion. In KDE, what command would execute the default terminal emulator?
- R: konsole
##### 3. What protocol is best suited to access a remote Windows desktop from a Linux desktop environment?
- R: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), soporte nativo en windows y linux
