Have you ever experienced, encountering a topic that is astonishingly interesting, becoming so absorbed that all of a sudden it's midnight? No way to have that feeling with this demonic app.

I have tried Pomodoro for almost week. Although it's cool to set a timetable, it makes me feel like a kid that needs his mom to tell him to study. I hate that approach since I study because I want to study. I enjoy acquiring knowledge and that's the situation I've chosen to live, no reminder should be needed.

Moreover, it pisses me off when the time goes off and I have to stop although it's 2 pages to finish the chapter. The fact that the pauses are agnostic to the content you are studying at that precise moment is pretty inefficient. So I uninstalled the app and never used it again.

The app censors the consequences of dissonance between your mind and your body. If you can't concentrate, it's because your dopamine and reward system is disrupted, while your body is at the desk, your mind is flying free. The app distracts you from addressing the root cause of your concentration problems by focusing on the symptoms. A person in harmony has their mind where their feet are, not flying far from their body. The solution would be to repair your reward system and undergo an honest and meticulous process of self-reflection.

Once you get your inner self in place, this app becomes absolutely unnecessary and counterproductive, since you'll just have to listen to your body to make the pauses, which in fact should not be that frequent.
